## Install backend modules

You need to have a working installation of Vanilla Adobe Commerce version 2.4.6

https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio/metapackages/open-source/


```bash
# To much reading to only need to run the following line an upload composer.json changes XD
# + composer.lock
# On backend installation or docker, run:
composer require magento/pwa
composer require magento/pwa-commerce
composer require magento/module-upward-connector:^2.0 --with-all-dependencies
# And also do an upgrade 
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
# For last do a reindex
php bin/magento indexer:reindex
```


# Magento GitHub

In this tutorial, the used version for Adobe Commerce 2.4.6 is pwa-studio v13.0.0

https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio/tree/v13.0.0


## Install PWA Dependencies

### Install this ONLY the first time

```bash
# Install curl
sudo apt install curl

# The following command use the 'master' branch, one reference use the branch v0.33.0
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash

# The master branch will output this:
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" 
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # This loads nvm bash_completion 
# Execute the commands if the output doesn't have it
 
# Install nvm version 16 or 15
nvm install 16
nvm use 16

# Install yarn
npm install --global yarn

# One reference indicates to install node, but maybe my Ubuntu has node installation by default
Install node

Now execute the commands:
```bash
yarn install

# The output, will show you the URL to view the PWA Venia project online
yarn watch:venia
# If you want to change the URL, check this link:
