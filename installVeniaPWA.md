Nos go to the URL indicated in the result:
https://psf-oamij.local.pwadev:8206/
Remember that you use
> yarn run buildpack create-custom-origin

to create a secure URL

# Check the results:

Yep, home is empty

<img src="./images/home.png" alt="Venia home" style="width:50%;border: 1px solid blue;">

But when you check the categories, you can see the products if you can't see products, and you have added products,
please do a reindex

<img src="./images/category.png" alt="Venia category" style="width:50%;border: 1px solid blue;">




# Use http://0.0.0.0:10000 as PWA URL

In console where the PWA is running, stop using CTRL + C [2 times]

In file ".env" change:

```text
CUSTOM_ORIGIN_ENABLED=false
DEV_SERVER_PORT=10000
```

Run again 
> yarn run watch

And the Venia PWA is running now at
http://0.0.0.0:10000/
